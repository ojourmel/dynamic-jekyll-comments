dynamic-jekyll-comments
=======================

Simple dynamic commenting system injected into Jekyll

---

Use a database and PHP setup to support dynamic comments in a Jekyll blog.
This project is very much a work in progress. The files listed in this repository will make it possible
to dynamicaly load comments into a Jekyll blog. This requires a Jekyll plugin to rewrite `.html` files to
`.php` files when Jekyll builds to blog. This plugin is inspired by [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/inky/1067860).

The issue tracker will be used to track progress, and give feedback to usage.

Special thanks to [Evan Seabrook](https://github.com/evangsea) for providing the base PHP system
